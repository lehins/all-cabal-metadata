changelog: ! "Changelog for the [`directory`][1] package\n==========================================\n\n##
  1.3.1.0 (March 2017)\n\n  * `findFile` (and similar functions): when an absolute
  path is given, the\n    list of search directories is now completely ignored.  Previously,
  if the\n    list was empty, `findFile` would always fail.\n    ([#72](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/72))\n\n
  \ * For symbolic links on Windows, the following functions had previously\n    interpreted
  paths as referring to the links themselves rather than their\n    targets.  This
  was inconsistent with other platforms and has been fixed.\n      * `getFileSize`\n
  \     * `doesPathExist`\n      * `doesDirectoryExist`\n      * `doesFileExist`\n\n
  \ * Fix incorrect location info in errors from `pathIsSymbolicLink`.\n\n  * Add
  functions for symbolic link manipulation:\n      * `createFileLink`\n      * `createDirectoryLink`\n
  \     * `removeDirectoryLink`\n      * `getSymbolicLinkTarget`\n\n  * `canonicalizePath`
  can now resolve broken symbolic links too.\n    ([#64](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/64))\n\n##
  1.3.0.2 (February 2017)\n\n  * [optimization] Increase internal buffer size of `copyFile`\n
  \   ([#69](https://github.com/haskell/directory/pull/69))\n\n  * Relax `time` version
  bounds to support 1.8.\n\n## 1.3.0.1 (January 2017)\n\n  * Relax `Win32` version
  bounds to support 2.5.\n    ([#67](https://github.com/haskell/directory/pull/67))\n\n##
  1.3.0.0 (December 2016)\n\n  * **[breaking]** Drop trailing slashes in `canonicalizePath`\n
  \   ([#63](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/63))\n\n  * **[deprecation]**
  Rename `isSymbolicLink` to `pathIsSymbolicLink`.  The\n    old name will remain
  available but may be removed in the next major\n    release.\n    ([#52](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/52))\n\n
  \ * Changed `canonicalizePath` to dereference symbolic links even if it points\n
  \   to a file and is not the last path segment\n\n  * On Windows, `canonicalizePath`
  now canonicalizes the letter case too\n\n  * On Windows, `canonicalizePath` now
  also dereferences symbolic links\n\n  * When exceptions are thrown, the error location
  will now contain additional\n    information about the internal function(s) used.\n\n##
  1.2.7.1 (November 2016)\n\n  * Don't abort `removePathForcibly` if files or directories
  go missing.\n    In addition, keep going even if an exception occurs.\n    ([#60](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/60))\n\n##
  1.2.7.0 (August 2016)\n\n  * Remove deprecated C bits.  This means `HsDirectory.h`
  and its functions\n    are no longer available.\n    ([#50](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/50))\n\n
  \ * Add `doesPathExist` and `getFileSize`\n    ([#57](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/57))\n\n
  \ * Add `renamePath`\n    ([#58](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/58))\n\n
  \ * Add `removePathForcibly`\n    ([#59](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/59))\n\n##
  1.2.6.3 (May 2016)\n\n  * Add missing import of `(<*>)` on Windows for `base` earlier
  than 4.8.0.0\n    ([#53](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/53))\n\n##
  1.2.6.2 (April 2016)\n\n  * Bundled with GHC 8.0.1\n\n  * Fix typo in file time
  functions when `utimensat` is not available and\n    version of `unix` package is
  lower than 2.7.0.0\n\n## 1.2.6.1 (April 2016)\n\n  * Fix mistake in file time functions
  when `utimensat` is not available\n    ([#47](https://github.com/haskell/directory/pull/47))\n\n##
  1.2.6.0 (April 2016)\n\n  * Make `findExecutable`, `findExecutables`, `findExecutablesInDirectories`,\n
  \   `findFile`, and `findFilesWith` lazier\n    ([#43](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/43))\n\n
  \ * Add `findFileWith`\n\n  * Add `copyFileWithMetadata`, which copies additional
  metadata\n    ([#40](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/40))\n\n  * Improve
  error message of `removeDirectoryRecursive` when used on a\n    directory symbolic
  link on Windows.\n\n  * Add `isSymbolicLink`\n\n  * Drop support for Hugs.\n\n##
  1.2.5.1 (February 2016)\n\n  * Improve error message of `getCurrentDirectory` when
  the current working\n    directory no longer exists\n    ([#39](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/39))\n\n
  \ * Fix the behavior of trailing path separators in `canonicalizePath` as well\n
  \   as `makeAbsolute` when applied to the current directory; they should now\n    match
  the behavior of `canonicalizePath` prior to 1.2.3.0 (when the bug\n    was introduced)\n
  \   ([#42](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/42))\n\n  * Set the location
  in IO errors from `makeAbsolute`.\n\n## 1.2.5.0 (December 2015)\n\n  * Add `listDirectory`,
  which is similar to `getDirectoryContents`\n    but omits `.` and `..`\n    ([#36](https://github.com/haskell/directory/pull/36))\n\n
  \ * Remove support for `--with-cc=` in `configure`; use the `CC=` flag instead\n
  \   ([ghc:D1608](https://phabricator.haskell.org/D1608))\n\n## 1.2.4.0 (September
  2015)\n\n  * Work around lack of `#const_str` when cross-compiling\n    ([haskell-cafe](F7D))\n\n
  \ * Add `findExecutablesInDirectories`\n    ([#33](https://github.com/haskell/directory/pull/33))\n\n
  \ * Add `exeExtension`\n\n[F7D]: https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2015-August/120892.html\n\n##
  1.2.3.1 (August 2015)\n\n  * Restore support for Safe Haskell with base < 4.8\n
  \   ([#30](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/30))\n\n## 1.2.3.0 (July
  2015)\n\n  * Add support for XDG Base Directory Specification\n    ([#6](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/6))\n\n
  \ * Implement `setModificationTime` counterpart to `getModificationTime`\n    ([#13](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/13))\n\n
  \ * Implement `getAccessTime` and `setAccessTime`\n\n  * Set the filename in IO
  errors from the file time functions\n\n  * Fix `canonicalizePath` so that it always
  returns a reasonable result even\n    if the path is inaccessible and will not throw
  exceptions unless the\n    current directory cannot be obtained\n    ([#23](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/23))\n\n
  \ * Corrected the trailing slash behavior of `makeAbsolute`\n    so that `makeAbsolute
  \"\" == makeAbsolute \".\"`\n\n  * Deprecate use of `HsDirectory.h` and `HsDirectoryConfig.h`\n\n
  \ * Implement `withCurrentDirectory`\n\n## 1.2.2.1 (Apr 2015)\n\n  * Fix dependency
  problem on NixOS when building with tests\n    ([#24](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/24))\n\n##
  1.2.2.0 (Mar 2015)\n\n  * Bundled with GHC 7.10.1\n\n  * Make `getModificationTime`
  support sub-second resolution on Windows\n\n  * Fix silent failure in `createDirectoryIfMissing`\n\n
  \ * Replace `throw` by better defined `throwIO`s\n\n  * Avoid stack overflow in
  `getDirectoryContents`\n    ([#17](https://github.com/haskell/directory/pull/17))\n\n
  \ * Expose `findExecutables`\n    ([#14](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/14))\n\n
  \ * `removeDirectoryRecursive` no longer follows symlinks under any\n    circumstances\n
  \   ([#15](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/15))\n\n  * Allow trailing
  path separators in `getPermissions` on Windows\n    ([#9](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/9))\n\n
  \ * `renameFile` now always throws the correct error type\n    (`InappropriateType`)
  when the destination is a directory, as long as the\n    filesystem is not being
  modified concurrently\n    ([#8](https://github.com/haskell/directory/pull/8))\n\n
  \ * Add `makeAbsolute`, which should be preferred over `canonicalizePath`\n    unless
  one requires symbolic links to be resolved\n\n## 1.2.1.0 (Mar 2014)\n\n  * Bundled
  with GHC 7.8.1\n\n  * Add support for sub-second precision in `getModificationTime`
  when\n    linked against `unix>=2.6.0.0`\n\n  * Fix `createDirectoryIfMissing _
  \".\"` in `C:\\` on Windows\n\n  * Remove support for NHC98 compiler\n\n  * Update
  package to `cabal-version >= 1.10` format\n\n  * Enhance Haddock documentation for
  `doesDirectoryExist` and\n    `canonicalizePath`\n\n  * Fix `findExecutable` to

description: ! "`directory`\n===========\n\n[![Hackage][hi]][hl]\n[![Build status][bi]][bl]\n[![Windows
  build status][wi]][wl]\n[![Dependencies status][di]][dl]\n\nDocumentation can be
  found on [Hackage][hl].\nChanges between versions are recorded in the [change log](changelog.md).\n\nBuilding
  from Git repository\n----------------------------\n\nWhen building this package
  directly from the Git repository, one must run\n`autoreconf -fi` to generate the
  `configure` script needed by `cabal\nconfigure`.  This requires [Autoconf][ac] to
  be installed.\n\n    autoreconf -fi\n    cabal install\n\nThere is no need to run
  the `configure` script manually however, as `cabal\nconfigure` does that automatically.\n\n[hi]:
